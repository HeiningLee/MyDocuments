# Lesson 1 A Private Conversation

上星期我去看戏。

Last week I went to the theater.

我的座位很好。

I had a very good seat.

戏很有意思。

The play was very interesting.

但我却无法欣赏。

I did not enjoy it.

一青年男子与一青年女子坐在我的身后，大声地说着话。

A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me. They were talking loudly.

我非常生气，因为我听不见演员在说什么。

I was very angry. I could not hear the actors.

I got very angry.

我回过头去怒视着那一男一女，他们却毫不理会。

I turned around. I looked at the man and the woman angrily. They did not pay any attention.

最后，我忍不住了，又一次回过头去，生气地说：“我一个字也听不见了！”

At last, I could not bear it. I turned around again. "I couldn't hear a word!" I said angrily.

In the end, 

“不关你的事，”那男的毫不客气地说，“这是私人间的谈话！”

"It's none of your business", said the man "It's a private conversation."
