那是个星期天.

It was Sunday.

I never get up early on Sunday.

I never get up early on Sundays.



有时我要一直躺到吃午饭的时候。

句型丰富起来。



上个星期天，我起得很晚。

Last Sunday, I got up very late.



我望望窗外，外面一片昏暗。

I looked out of the window. It was dark outside.



“鬼天气！”我想，“又下雨了。”

"What a day!", I thought, "It's raining again."

'What a day!' I thought. 'It's raining again.'



正在这时，电话铃响了。

Just then, the telephone rang.



是我姑母露西打来的。

It was my aunt Lucy.



“我刚下火车，”她说，“我这就来看你。”

"I've just arrived by train", she said, "I'm coming to see you."



“但我还在吃早饭，”我说。

"But I'm still having breakfast," I said.



“你在干什么？”她问道。

"What are you doing?"she asked.



“我正在吃早饭，”我又说了一遍。

"I'm having breakfast,"I repeated.



“天啊，”她说，“你总是起得这么晚吗？现在已经1点钟了！”

"Dear me!" she said. " Do you always get up so late? It's 1 o'clock!"
